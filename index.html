            Hi, my name is Lluvia. I'm 16 years old, I'm from Mexico, and lately,
            I've been wondering how I'll pass this course. But I'll pass it no matter what it takes!
            I really like reading books, especially fantasy books.
            Reading them takes me on new adventures and makes me feel as if I'm part of the story.
            It's as if I'm experiencing it myself as it happens!

            Mexico is a country in North America, along with Canada and the United States. 
            It is also part of Latin America because the language spoken there is Spanish, a Romance language. 
            Mexico is a multicultural country and a megadiverse country. 
            It is also known for its cuisine and friendly people!
